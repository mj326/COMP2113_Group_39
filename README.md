## Code Requirement
1. Generation of random game sets or events
    - The game contains a random generation of drawing cards from the deck.
    - The deck is shuffled for random drawn cards from including the random library.
2. Data structures for storing game status
    - The game saves and updates player info(balance) after each round is over.
    - Classes, 'this' pointers, and vectors are used as data structures for storing game status.
3. Dynamic memory management
    - Iterators and pointers are used for dynamic memory management.
    - The game includes functions to make player take one card the deck each turn. It removes the card from the playerâ€™s arraylist(hand) and adds it back to deck which includes the resizing function.
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
    - The directory contains "players.txt" file in order to save player.
    - fstream library is used to open file and store name, final balance of the player.
5. Program codes in multiple files
    - card.cpp, card.h for card related functions
    - player.cpp, player.h for player related functions
    - game.cpp, game.h for game related functions
    - main.cpp for main function
    - Makefile for making main, and cleaning the directory(deleting *.o, main)
6. Proper indentation and naming styles/In-code documentation
    - Every function and code has proper indentation, names related to its function and purpose.

## Features Implemented
- Classes(public, protected, private) for storing player information
- Namespace(namespace Card_namespace) for displaying calculating cards to integer
- Template(typename T) for simplified and concise code
- Various types of functions(void, int, double) for running the game
- Exceptions(try, catch, throw, default) for dynamic work flow

## To start the game 
- The player has to register his name 
- To register a new player, current player needs to end his game.
- If not registered, player cannot start the game.

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND to increase the terminal size for a better view of cards and for a smooth play.

## Game Description

1. Shuffle the cards.
2. Player bets.($10, $20, $30) -> Show Starting_Balance and subtract betting amount from balance.
      a) Starting balance is $100
         - Player LOSES if balance < 10. -> End Game
3. Player and dealer each draws two cards.
4. Show each cards except dealer's hidden card. (Total 3 cards shown)
5. BLACKJACK == sum of cards is 21.
      1. Player is BLACKJACK, player automatically WINS -> player receives bet_money*3 -> Round over
      2. Dealer is BLACKJACK, player automatically LOSES -> Round over
      3. If no BLACKJACK, move on.
      
6. Player's turn. Print two choices and select one:
      1. STAY
         - Player's turn is over and dealer shows hidden card.
            1. If player's card sum < dealer's card sum, player LOSES -> Round over
            2. If player's card sum > dealer's card sum OR dealer's card sum > 21, player WINS -> player receives
            bet_money*2 -> Round over
      2. HIT
         - Player draws another card. (If the player's card sum < 21, player goes back to step 5.)
            1. If player card sum > 21 OR player card sum < dealer card sum, player LOSES -> Round over
            2. If player card sum > dealer card sum, player WINS -> player receives bet_money*2 -> Round over

7. Dealer's turn.
    1. If card sum of dealer <= 16
        - dealer automatically draws another card. -> print the card
    2. If card sum of dealer > 21
        - dealer bursts and player WINS -> player receives bet_money*2 -> Round over
    3. If card sum of dealer > 16 and less than 22 -> compare card sum
        - if dealer card sum > player card sum -> player LOSE -> Round over
        - if dealer card sum < player card sum -> player WINS -> player receives bet_money*2 -> Round over

      
8. Player decided which amount to bet from the options($10, $20, $30)
   - if player LOSE: balance -= bet_money
   - if player WINS: balance += bet_money * 2
   - if player WINS by BLACKJACK: balance += bet_money * 3


## Game Example

Let's assume that the player chose bet_money as $10. 

1. If dealer's card sum > 21,
    - If player's card sum <= 21 (Player wins)
        1. Show dealer's hidden card.
        2. Get win money($20). -> Round over
    - If player's card sum > 21: (It's a tie)
        1. Show dealer's hidden card.
        2. Get initial betting amount -> Round over

2. If player's card sum > 2,
    - If dealer's card sum <= 21: (Player loses)
        1. Show dealer's hidden card.
        2. Lose betting amount(-$10) -> Round over
    - If dealer's card sum > 21:  (It's a tie)
        1. Show dealer's hidden card.
        2. Get initial betting amount -> Round over

    - If player's card sum <=21 (and dealer's card <21)  :
        1. Player takes turn
            -> Show dealer's hidden card after player has chosen either stand or hit
            - If dealer's card sum == 21 -> Lose betting amount -> Round over
            - Calculate card sums and show who wins -> Round over

7. Ask to play again after each round ends
8. Play again -> Go to step 1.
9. End game -> Print ending message, use updatePlayer() to update currentPlayer on Players.txt and return

## How to start the game (Makefile)
1. Use makefile to run the game: make main -> ./main
2. Use makefile to clean directory: make clean
